    <h1>Welcome/Bienvenue!</h1>
    <p>This webpage is to explain what I am learning. That is, HTML and its syntax, which includes void
    elements, attributes, and the general layout of an HTML file. Headings and paragraphs are a large part
    of a language's syntax, so there must be a structure with a hierarchy of terms to indicate as such within
    the documents code. There are also aspects like web page
    metadata, which is data that accurately describes the document and its data. That would be code
    like describing what kind of characters the document is allowed to use and display. For example,
    this document simply uses a set that would allow the display of any human language. 你好 - Ni Hao,
    Mandarin Chinese formal greeting for "Hello." Other metadata elements include name and content. Name
    indicates what the element is and relates to, while content specifies that meta element. Whether it is
    an author and their name, or an image with a description, the name/content combination can be used in a
    lot of ways.</p>
    <p>The last thing to learn for this week is emphasis within the HTML document. Important font
    manipulation like bold or italicize to show importance and <strong>clarify</strong> the meaning of
    words.</p>
